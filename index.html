<h3>History</h3>

<p>Seoul's history began with Paleolithic settlements, developing into the Baekje capital Wiryeseong by 18 BC, then becoming Joseon's capital Hanyang in 1394, which it remained throughout centuries of change and invasions. During Japanese colonial rule, the city was known as Gyeongseong but regained the name Seoul upon Korea's liberation in 1945. Despite near-total destruction during the Korean War, Seoul underwent rapid post-war reconstruction and industrialization, transforming into the modern metropolis and capital of the Republic of Korea it is today.</p>
